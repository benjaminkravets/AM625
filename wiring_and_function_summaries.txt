MT25QL128ABA1ESE_littlefs
littlefs 2.11

build steps:
1. Add littlefs source/headers to littefs and include in build
2. Enable I2C1 to communicate with TCA6424 to enable 3V3_EN
3. add spi driver support to MT25Q and include in build

spi_try- test SPI2 on user expansion header pins 38/40?

MT25Q - 
Each device in a system should have the VCC line decoupled by a suitable capacitor (typically 100nF) close to the package pins.

When using single and dual I/O commands
on these parts, DQ3 must be driven HIGH by the host, or an external pull-up resistor
must be placed on the PCB, in order to avoid allowing the HOLD# or RESET# input to
float.
